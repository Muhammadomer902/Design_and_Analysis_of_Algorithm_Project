# Design_and_Analysis_of_Algorithm_Project
My solution of Common Dynamic Programming Problems done in a Efficient way regarding Time Complexity.
It was a collaborative Project done with my group member, he did Q1 & Q2 while I did Q3 &Q4.
Tested for Various Cases to solve the problem most efficiently in the Mentioned Time Complexity.
Q3 : O(n)
Q4 : O(mn^2)
Questions are included in the "Questions.pdf".
Detailed working is include in "DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM.docx".
